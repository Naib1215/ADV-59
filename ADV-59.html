    <p>I have a lot of hobbies like: Coding, Playing Chess and Table-tennis, Watching the news and documentaries, Reading books, and etc. But <br>among all of these stuff, what I like the most is Coding. Now through all these activities, I can explore my various skills. Also, these <br>activities, help me to be healthy and fit, as they force me to maintain a healthy diet with regular exercises, and exerting constant focus on my <br>academic's and co-curricular activities.</p>
